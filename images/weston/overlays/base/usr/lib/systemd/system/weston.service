# This is a system unit for launching Weston with auto-login as the
# user configured here.
#
# Weston must be built with systemd support, and your weston.ini must load
# the plugin systemd-notify.so.

# This scope is created by pam_systemd when logging in as the user.
# This directive is a workaround to a systemd bug, where the setup of the
# user session by PAM has some race condition, possibly leading to a failure.
# See README for more details.
